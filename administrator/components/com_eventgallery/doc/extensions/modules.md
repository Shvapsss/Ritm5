## Cart Module {#module-cart}

The cart module can be used to display the current cart for a user on every page. If you use this module you can turn off the components internal cart. If the cart feature should work correctly at least one cart is necessary. Otherwise the add2cart action will fail. 

## Event Module {#module-event}

The main purpose of this module is to show exactly one event somewhere on your page. You can define parameters like the event, the thumb size and the number of images you want to show. 

If you installed the module there is a new instance which you can find with the Joomla Module Manager. Make sure the module is configured correctly and shows up on at least one page. By default it is not assigned to any page or to any position in your template.

## Latest Event Module {#module-latest-event}

Shows a number of images from the latest event. You can define the meaning of "latest" using the settings for the event sorting. In addition the module has a setting for the event history position which allows you to configure for example three instances of this module type to display the three latest events.
