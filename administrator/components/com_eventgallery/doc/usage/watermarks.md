# Manage Watermarks {#ManageWatermarks}

If you want to brand images of event with a watermark you can define a number of different watermark configurations here. Once you created at least one here you can use them for an event. Check the event section for details.

If you save a watermark configuration you'll find a preview on top which shows how a watermark would look like if it's applied to an image.

Here are the options you have to set up your watermark:

- Name

	The name of this watermark configuration. This is just an information for you.

- Description

	The description of an watermark. Here you can add some notes to yourself. It's not used while rendering a watermark.

- Image

	The image which is used as watermark.	

- Margin Horizontal

	Defines the horizontal margin of the watermark. This setting is relative to the image size. 

- Margin Vertical

	Defines the vertical margin of the watermark. This setting is relative to the image size. 

- Opacity

	Defines the opacity of the watermark. 0 will make the watermark invisible.

- Position

	Where should we place the watermark image.

- Mode

	Choose how the watermark image should be rendered on the image. Fill means the watermark is just copied on the image. Fit will fit the watermark to 100% of the width of the image. The proportional setting allows a little bit more adjustments of the size of the watermark.

- Proportional

	If you select the proportional mode you can use this parameter to adjust the size of the watermark on the image. 100 means to fill 100% of the width.

- Published

	Is this watermark visible in the front end? Only published watermark configurations are applied in the front end rendering process. If you assign a unpublished watermark to an event the images will not be watermarked.
